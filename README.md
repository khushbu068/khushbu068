- âš¡ Fun fact: The term "debugging" originated from a surprisingly literal event in 1947 involving the Harvard Mark II computer. Grace Hopper, a renowned computer scientist and Navy rear admiral, encountered a glitch in the system and traced it back to a moth trapped in one of the relays. She famously quipped, "First actual case of bug being found." This amusing incident not only gave rise to the term "debugging" but also showcases the ingenuity and humor prevalent among early programmers.
